Coding Countdown: The Numbers Round


The objective of the Countdown numbers game is to make a target number 
(a randomly generated integer between 100 and 999) from six other pseudo-randomly selected numbers in the set 
[100, 75, 50, 25, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1].
The numbers 1-10 may appear more than once, and contestants have some say in their distribution,
for example ‘one large (i.e. in the 25-100 group) and five small (i.e. in the 1-10 group)’.

## Rules

The following rules apply:

1. Only the operations +, -, x and / (plus, minus, times, divide) are allowed.
1. Brackets may be used, e.g. (1+3) x 10 = 40.
1. All intermediately calculated numbers must be positive integers, 
e.g. (5 / 2) * 10 = 25 is not permissible as 5 / 2 = 2.5; 
1. A number may only be used as many times as it appears in the initial set of six.
1. It is not necessary to use all of the numbers.
